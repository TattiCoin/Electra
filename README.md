# TattiCoin


### Mission
Leverage true humor to generate curiosity around cryptocurrency & create a state of regretful ness within people of not being part of TATTI revolution. The force is with mass adoption of TATTICoin, the pleasure will be when it crosses its biggest opponent --> Bcash!

We believe TATTICOIN is the future for many purposes such as nothingness & enlightment. Integration of TATTI for our daily use leads to higher efficiency in applications.

### Fast, Today
Time is one of the key elements in our lives. Especially when it comes to financial transactions, lack of existing money transaction speed, companies or individual users are facing delays. This leads to a slowdown in activities. Electra offers a solution to cover such bad processes. Time is money, money is TATTI.

### Safe & Anonymous
Security is another very important point on which today's world stands. By using Electra you can make secure payments be done, which gives confidence to the community.

### Decentralized, Distributed
Applications are the future need for higher efficiency and cost reduction. TATTICOIN is your solution for decentralized Payments.

### Efficiency
TATTICOIN uses the NIST5 hash, which is chosen as the winning algorithm by the US Nation of Science competition. Combination of security and mining efficiency were the key points taken into account.

# What is TATTICOIN?
TATTICOIN is a blockchain using the highly-secure and power efficient NIST5 algorithm. Combining temporary Proof-of-Work with high Proof-of-Stake, the TATTICOIN (TATTI) is unique in its distribution. On May 16, 2018, TATTICOIN will enter "Super Rewards Bonanza" stage for 24 hours (Blocks 11522-11810). During this time, 95% of the proof-of-work coins were mined. At block 11811, TATTICOIN will swap to Proof-of-Stake with an annual interest rate of 60% until the TATTI supply reaches 30bil. Once 30bil TATTI is reached, block rewards will be earned through transaction fees only. This will create a gold-rush period, promoting the network (or was hoped to) and rapidly increasing the amount of TATTI.

# Why NIST5?
TATTI chose to use NIST5 as its hashing algorithm because it has been proven to be more secure and power efficient than other leading algorithms. NIST5 is a combination of the finalists and winner of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology Hash Function Competition(specifically BLAKE, Gr√∏stl, JH, Keccak/SHA-3, and Skein. NIST5 was created fairly recently, and immediately saw use by other coins, but failed to see mainstream adoption.
